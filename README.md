In this challenge I was tasked with using Leaflet to create a map that shows the impact of earthquakes on earth. I selected to use all magnitude 4.5 and above earthquakes in the last 30 days. Found here. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php . 
The size of the circle is based off of the magnitude of the quake most of these seemed to hover around 5 so there is little variation.
The color is function of the depth of the earthquake where the darker the color the deeper the quake.
